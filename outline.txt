- Introduction
  Background
  Research Objectives
  
  
- Methodology
  Deciding on the Model/Model Selection - quantitative, qualitative, and financial economic reasons in choosing variables of interest before data-finding
  Datasets & Variable Description
  EDA
  Model Specification (latex)
  Model Diagnostics (assuring validity / referring to appendix for plots)
  
  
- Results
  two models (logistic, LMM) for SPY - coefficient interpretations, p-values, etc.
  two models (logistic, LMM) for VIX - coefficient interpretations, p-values, etc.


- Discussion
  what went cool, not-so-cool in the modeling and the model results
  how can this be immediately useful - simply buy fri sell mon (outright, spxl, options, passive-buy fri-or-not strategy), cash secured puts, binary options - look into annualized returns w/ sd
  
  
- Appendix
  figures, plots, etc.
