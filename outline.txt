  Background
  Objective
  
  
- Methodology
  Timeframe Selection
  Dataset Creation
    Predictor Variables (fixed)
      - SPY, VIX
      - Friday stuff: how much Friday's close was compared to previous day's close, double witch day (Indicator) &&&& NFP (first friday of each month) - percent "off" quantified
        &&&& UMich Consumer Sentiment (every other Friday; prelim or final) - amount "off", no need to calculate percent since it is already on 0-100 scale
      - non-Friday stuff that still is deemed important: weekly FOMC (or not) 
    RANDOM EFFECT
      - (monday open price - preceding friday's close price) data, and assign each data point a "month" based o the preceding friday's month --> ANOVA
    Response Variables To Consider
      - monday OPEN price
      - monday CLOSE price
    
  Deciding on the Model/Model Selection - quantitative, qualitative, and financial economic reasons in choosing variables of interest before data-finding
  Datasets & Variable Description
  EDA
  Model Specification (latex)
  Model Diagnostics (assuring validity / referring to appendix for plots)
  
  
- Results
  two models (logistic, LMM) for SPY - coefficient interpretations, p-values, etc. OR just LMM for monday OPEN and monday CLOSE
  two models (logistic, LMM) for VIX - coefficient interpretations, p-values, etc.


- Discussion
  what went cool, not-so-cool in the modeling and the model results
  how can this be immediately useful - simply buy fri sell mon (outright, spxl, options, passive-buy fri-or-not strategy), cash secured puts, binary options - look into annualized returns w/ sd
